# **Traveltide Customer Segmentation Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This study project focuses on identifying distinct customer segments for **Traveltide, a fictional travel booking website**, with the aim of developing more targeted marketing strategies to improve customer retention and generate repeat business.
