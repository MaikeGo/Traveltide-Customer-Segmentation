### **Executive Summary: Findings and Recommendations**

Our analysis of **Traveltide's fictional website data** identified seven distinct customer segments for more targeted marketing strategies, based on user behavior, spending patterns, and responsiveness to discounts. This segmentation will enable more effective and personalized engagement, ultimately driving customer retention and repeat business.

#### **Key Findings**
- The **Big Spenders** segment comprises high-value customers who consistently spend above average on both flights and hotels. They represent a significant revenue opportunity.
- **Bargain Hunters** were split into two groups:
  - **High-Spenders** who value discounts but still spend a lot.
  - **Budget Bargain Hunters** who seek deals and spend less overall.
- **Luxury Lovers** prefer premium experiences, spending more on flights, hotels, or longer stays.
- The **Zero Bookers** segment, consisting of users with no bookings, represents a conversion opportunity.
- Remaining customers were classified as **Frequent** and **Infrequent Travelers**, with potential to be influenced by tailored offers based on their booking frequency.

| 4     | Bargain Hunters (Budget)       | 1,150          | Exclusive Discounts (10%)                     |

| 7     | Other Infrequent Travelers     | 853            | Exclusive Discounts (10%) + Discount on Next Booking |

#### **Recommendations**
- **Big Spenders**: Offer the "1 Night Free (with Flight Booking)" perk to encourage continued loyalty and high-value bookings.
- **Bargain Hunters**: Target both sub-groups with "Exclusive Discounts" to drive conversions. **It's recommended to experiment with different discount levels (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%) to identify the optimal rate that maximizes engagement and spending.**
- **Luxury Lovers**: Highlight premium experiences, offering the "Free Hotel Meal" perk.
- **Zero Bookers**: Use the "Free Checked Bag" perk along with an **Irresistible 'First Booking' Offer** (e.g., 20% off the first booking) to motivate them to start booking.
- **Frequent Travelers**: Provide "No Cancellation Fees" to cater to their flexible travel needs.
- **Infrequent Travelers**: Offer "Exclusive Discounts" and an additional **'Book Now and Secure a Discount on Your Next Booking'** perk to encourage repeat bookings.

#### **Limitations and Future Testing**
- There is some overlap and fuzziness between segments, which may be refined further through ongoing testing and additional analysis
- The analysis is based on historical data, and customer behaviors may change over time. Some segments, such as Zero Bookers, do not have enough data points to predict future behavior accurately.
- Discount responsiveness and preferences might differ by user segment, travel season, or booking circumstances. Therefore, it's essential to conduct **A/B testing** to validate the effectiveness of these perks and make data-driven adjustments as needed.
- Further analysis should be conducted on other variables such as booking seasonality, user demographics, and trip purpose to refine targeting.

This segmentation and perk assignment will help refine marketing strategies, but ongoing testing and optimization are crucial to ensure maximum effectiveness.
